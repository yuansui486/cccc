    The ``khqZz`` (``GET_CONVERSATION_TURNS``) response packs each AI answer

    fast on Google-side shape drift. The legacy

        Per ADR-0014 Rule 2 Corollary, ``ChatAPI`` depends on the
        **direct** collaborators it actually exercises rather than a
        chat-local Runtime Protocol that bundles them. ``ChatAPI`` takes
        the four underlying collaborators (``rpc``, ``transport``,
        ``reqid``, ``loop_guard``) by keyword argument.

        Args:
            rpc: RPC dispatch collaborator (the client's
                ``internals.executor`` / ``RpcExecutor``) for the
                ``get_conversation_*``, ``configure``,
                ``delete_conversation``, and ``save_answer_as_note``
                round-trips.
            transport: :class:`RuntimeTransport` collaborator (the client's
                ``_composed.transport``) that owns the authed-POST entry
                point used by :meth:`ask` via
                :func:`chat_aware_authed_post`.
            reqid: :class:`ReqidCounter` collaborator (the client's
                ``internals.collaborators.reqid``) that mints the
                per-attempt ``_reqid`` query parameter for the streamed
                chat request.
            loop_guard: :class:`LoopGuard` collaborator (the client's
                ``internals.collaborators.lifecycle``) whose
                :meth:`assert_bound_loop` fires before :meth:`ask`
                acquires the per-conversation lock so a cross-loop
                follow-up doesn't hang on a lock bound to a dead loop.
            chat_timeout: Per-read HTTP timeout, in seconds, for the streamed
                chat endpoint. Defaults to the chat-specific shared-notebook
                first-byte window. ``None`` inherits the underlying transport
                timeout.
            conversation_cache: Optional injected cache; defaults to a fresh
                per-instance ``ConversationCache`` (chat-domain state, no
                other consumer).
            notebooks: Optional source-id resolver. Defaults to a
                ``NotebooksAPI`` wrapper around ``rpc`` so a bare
                ``ChatAPI(rpc=..., transport=..., reqid=..., loop_guard=...)``

        the web UI's "Save to note" button uses.

        Args:
            notebook_id: The notebook ID.
            ask_result: Result from a prior ``client.chat.ask()`` call.
                Must have non-empty ``references`` — otherwise this
                method raises :class:`ValueError`.
            title: Note title. When ``None`` (default), a title is
                derived from the first 50 characters of the answer
                (``AskResult`` does not currently carry the original
                question, so the answer is used). An empty string
                (``""``) is passed through verbatim — i.e. treated as
                "use this exact (empty) title", NOT as "use default".
                The NotebookLM server may apply smart-title generation
                regardless; the returned ``Note.title`` reflects what
                the server actually stored.

        Returns:
            The created ``Note``. ``Note.content`` holds the answer text
            WITH ``[N]`` markers; the rich citation anchors live
            server-side and surface via the NotebookLM web UI.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If ``ask_result.references`` is empty. Callers
                without citations should fall back to
                :meth:`NotesAPI.create` for plain-text notes — this
                method raises rather than silently degrading so the
                caller can decide.
