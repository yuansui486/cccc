"""Inline ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` recovery for the cookie-load preflight (issue #865).

Background:

``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` is the rotating freshness partner of ``__Secure-1PSID``.
It is minted reliably only by the dedicated ``accounts.google.com/RotateCookies``
POST that the keepalive loop in :mod:`notebooklm._auth.keepalive` uses. The
Playwright login flow substitutes two passive ``goto()`` navigations, which
Google does not always answer with ``Set-Cookie: __Secure-1PSIDTS``. When that
happens, ``storage_state.json`` is saved without PSIDTS, the Tier-1 preflight
in :mod:`notebooklm._auth.cookie_policy` rejects the next CLI invocation, and
the keepalive recovery path (which would heal the state in one POST) is
unreachable because it only runs inside an opened ``NotebookLMClient`` — a closed loop.

The header comment on ``MINIMUM_REQUIRED_COOKIES`` has always described PSIDTS
as ``directly accepted by Google's homepage check, OR recoverable via the
RotateCookies POST when other auth cookies are intact``. This module wires the
recoverable arm of that policy into the cold-start load path: when ``SID`` is
present and a valid secondary binding (``OSID``, or ``APISID + SAPISID``) is
intact but PSIDTS is missing, fire one ``RotateCookies`` POST, persist the
rotated cookies to disk via the existing snapshot/delta save, and let the
preflight retry.

The hard-Tier-1 classification of PSIDTS in ``MINIMUM_REQUIRED_COOKIES`` is
intentionally preserved so any caller that bypasses :func:`_recover_psidts_inline`
still sees a strict reject. Future work (option B, tracked separately): demote
PSIDTS to Tier 2 outright and rely on a session-open prime to mint it before
the first RPC. That change touches the lifecycle ordering and is out of scope
for this fix.

    """In-memory ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` recovery for the browser-extraction path.

    Variant of :func:`_recover_psidts_inline` for the CLI ``--browser-cookies``
    flows (``_enumerate_one_jar``, ``_write_extracted_cookies``) that operate
    on rookiepy cookie lists before any persistence. The file-based recovery
    is unreachable here because nothing has been written to disk yet — the
    cookies live only in the caller's in-memory list.

    Preconditions match the file-based recovery (see
    :func:`_recover_psidts_inline`):

    1. ``SID`` present.
    2. ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` absent, OR present but past its ``expires`` epoch
       (a ``-1``/``None`` session-cookie expiry counts as present, not
       expired — see :func:`_psidts_needs_recovery`).
    3. Secondary binding intact (``OSID``, or ``APISID + SAPISID``).

    On success, mutates ``rookiepy_cookies`` to append the rotated
    ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` (and ``__Secure-3PSIDTS``) entries in rookiepy's
    snake_case format. Downstream
    :func:`notebooklm._auth.cookies.convert_rookiepy_cookies_to_storage_state`
    picks them up on re-conversion.

    No file lock and no in-process throttle: the browser-extraction path is a
    one-shot CLI invocation that runs before any persistence. Concurrent CLI
    processes would each be operating on their own in-memory list — the
    cross-process flock in the file-based recovery exists to coordinate
    writes to a shared ``storage_state.json``, which doesn't apply here.

    Returns ``True`` if the rotation succeeded and the in-memory list now
    contains ``__Secure-1PSIDTS``; ``False`` otherwise.

    retry through :func:`recover_psidts_in_memory` (issue #990). When the

    secondary binding intact — see :func:`_psidts_needs_recovery`), the
    rotated cookies are appended to ``rookiepy_cookies`` in place so
    downstream persistence picks them up.

    Lives in the auth subpackage rather than the CLI login package so both
    CLI call sites can route through ``notebooklm.auth`` without adding a
    new sibling-import edge to the login-package DAG.

    Returns:
        ``(storage_state, error)``. When ``error`` is ``None`` the validation
        succeeded (possibly after recovery); when not, ``error`` is the final
        ``ValueError`` and ``storage_state`` is the latest extraction attempt.
