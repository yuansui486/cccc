    """Authentication tokens for NotebookLM API.

    Attributes:
        cookies: Required Google auth cookies keyed by ``(name, domain, path)``
            per RFC 6265 §5.3 (issue #369). Legacy 2-tuple ``(name, domain)``
            and flat ``name -> value`` shapes are still accepted on
            construction and widened to the path-aware shape by
            :func:`normalize_cookie_map` during ``__post_init__``.
        csrf_token: CSRF token (SNlM0e) extracted from page
        session_id: Session ID (FdrFJe) extracted from page
        storage_path: Path to the storage_state.json file, if file-based auth was used
        cookie_jar: Domain-preserving httpx.Cookies jar. Preferred over flat cookies dict
            for HTTP operations as it retains original cookie domains (e.g.,
            .googleusercontent.com vs .google.com).
        authuser: Google ``authuser`` index this profile authenticates as.
            ``0`` (the default account) is used when no account metadata is
            present in ``context.json`` — matching pre-multi-account behavior.
        account_email: Stable Google account identity for routing. When set,
            NotebookLM requests use it as the ``authuser`` value instead of the
            integer index, because Google account indices can change when other
            accounts sign out.
        cookie_snapshot: Internal save baseline used when a pre-client token
            fetch mutates cookies but persistence fails or CAS-rejects. This
            lets the eventual client retry the unpersisted delta instead
            of snapshotting the already-mutated jar as clean state.
