    cron-driven ``notebooklm auth refresh``) would otherwise race on the read-
    merge-write cycle and lose updates. The lock is held on a sentinel file
    sibling to the storage file (``.storage_state.json.lock``, derived by
    :func:`notebooklm._auth.paths._storage_state_lock_path`), since locking the
    storage file itself would interfere with the atomic temp-rename below.

    ``_auth/account.py`` holds this *same* sentinel via ``filelock.FileLock``

    serialized back to disk so the session remains valid across CLI invocations.

    If auth was loaded from an environment variable (no file), this is a no-op.

    Cross-process safety: the read-merge-write cycle is wrapped in an OS-level
    file lock (``.storage_state.json.lock``) so concurrent writers from
    different Python processes (e.g. an in-process ``NotebookLMClient`` keepalive

      ``RuntimeWarning`` safety advisory about that race (this is a permanent
      back-compat shim, not a scheduled deprecation, so the advisory is a
      ``RuntimeWarning`` and is not silenced by ``NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS``).
      Kept only as a public-API back-compat shim for callers outside this repo;
      every first-party caller passes ``original_snapshot``.
    - **Snapshot/delta (``original_snapshot`` provided)**: only cookies
      whose in-memory persisted tuple differs from the snapshot are written, and
      cookies present in the snapshot but no longer in the jar are
      deleted from disk. Cookies the in-process code never touched are
      left untouched on disk so a sibling-process write survives.
      Path-aware ``(name, domain, path)`` keys are used here (also closes

    Args:
        cookie_jar: The httpx.Cookies object containing the latest cookies.
        path: Path to storage_state.json. If None, cookie sync is skipped.

            deletions relative to the snapshot are persisted.
        return_result: Internal escape hatch for callers that need CAS-rejected
            keys to maintain a per-cookie baseline. Public callers should use
            the default bool return.

    Returns:
        ``True`` if the disk state now reflects the caller's intent (write
        succeeded, was a successful no-op, or the call was a deliberate skip
        because auth was loaded from an env var). ``False`` if an I/O error
        prevented the save or a CAS guard preserved a sibling-process write.

    """Snapshot/delta merge: write only what this process actually changed.

    Closes §3.4.1 (stale-overwrite-fresh) and §3.4.2 (path collapse):

    - **Deltas (CAS-guarded for keys in the snapshot)**: cookies in the
      jar whose snapshot tuple (``value, expires, secure, http_only``)
      differs from ``original_snapshot`` are written to disk **only if**
      the on-disk value still matches the snapshot value. If disk has
      rotated since open time, a sibling process has written it; we
      preserve their write rather than clobber it with our local
      rotation. New cookies acquired during the session are written only
      when no same-key storage row exists yet; an existing row means a
      sibling acquired the same cookie first. Comparing the full snapshot
      tuple keeps attribute-only refreshes (same value, new ``expires``)
      flowing to disk, but CAS remains value-only because attribute-only
      sibling drift is routine session metadata and should not wedge later
      value rotations.
    - **Deletions (CAS-guarded)**: a key present in the snapshot but
      absent from the jar is dropped from disk **only if** the on-disk
      value still matches the snapshot value — symmetric with the
      value-update CAS above. An ``Max-Age=0`` that evicted our
      locally-expired copy must not erase the sibling's freshly-issued
      replacement.
    - **Untouched**: cookies in the jar whose tuple matches the snapshot
      are not written, so a sibling-process write to the same key
      survives. Cookies on disk that are not in the snapshot are also
      left alone (they belong to a sibling process or another path).

    Args:
        cookie_jar: Current in-memory cookie jar.
        storage_data: Mutable storage_state.json dict (modified in place).
        original_snapshot: Open-time snapshot of the same jar.

    Returns:
        Tuple of ``(updated_count, cas_rejected_keys)``:

        - ``updated_count``: cookie entries added, modified, or removed
          (drives whether the temp-write step runs).
        - ``cas_rejected_keys``: keys whose CAS check rejected a delta or
          deletion. Caller uses this to advance the baseline only for keys
          that were actually written or already matched.
