"""HTML/WIZ field token extraction (CSRF, session ID, generic WIZ data).

NotebookLM (and other Google products) embed a JavaScript object literal named
``WIZ_global_data`` in the page chrome. Tokens like ``SNlM0e`` (CSRF) and
``FdrFJe`` (session ID) live inside that object. The helpers in this module
are the single place that knows how to parse the embedding, so all callers
benefit from the same drift tolerance and diagnostics.

Public surface (re-exported from ``notebooklm.auth``):

* :func:`extract_wiz_field` — generic ``WIZ_global_data[key]`` extractor.
* :func:`extract_csrf_from_html` — convenience wrapper for ``SNlM0e``.
* :func:`extract_session_id_from_html` — convenience wrapper for ``FdrFJe``.

Private helpers (also re-exported as white-box affordances for tests):

* :func:`_build_wiz_field_patterns` — the ordered regex patterns.
* :func:`_safe_url` — credential-stripping URL formatter for error messages.

    Patterns are tried in priority order: canonical double-quoted form first,

    (which may be empty — empty tokens are legitimate, not a drift signal).

    All three variants tolerate backslash-escaped delimiters inside the value
    so JSON-style escapes like ``"key":"a\\"b"`` parse correctly. The inner
    character class ``[^"\\\\]*(?:\\\\.[^"\\\\]*)*`` is the standard
    "string with escapes" idiom: consume runs of non-quote/non-backslash
    chars, optionally followed by an escape pair (``\\.``) and another run.

    The HTML-escaped variant uses a tempered-dot lookahead so the capture
    stops only at a literal ``&quot;`` terminator (not at any ``&`` — values
    legitimately contain ``&amp;`` and similar entities).

    Whitespace tolerance (``\\s*``) around the colon mirrors the original
    ``extract_csrf_from_html`` regex so we don't regress.
