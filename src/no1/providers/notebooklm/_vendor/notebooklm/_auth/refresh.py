"""Refresh-cmd coordination + token-fetch entry points for authentication.

This private module owns the ``NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD`` subprocess flow, the
per-loop coalescing of refresh attempts, and the public ``fetch_tokens`` /
``fetch_tokens_with_domains`` entry points. ``notebooklm.auth`` re-exports
every name listed here; the facade write-through in ``_AuthFacadeModule``
mirrors any monkeypatched values back to this module so the existing white-box
tests (``monkeypatch.setattr(auth_mod, "_run_refresh_cmd", ...)``,
``..., "snapshot_cookie_jar"``, etc.) keep working after the move.

Logger name is pinned to ``"notebooklm.auth"`` (NOT ``__name__``) so existing
``caplog`` assertions targeting ``notebooklm.auth`` keep matching the records
emitted from the moved bodies.

    By default, the command string is parsed with :func:`shlex.split` and

    like pipes, redirection, or env-var expansion).

    Environment forwarding:
        The refresh command inherits the **full parent environment** (so it
        can find ``PATH``, ``HOME``, proxy settings, and any custom config the
        operator relies on), with three deliberate adjustments:

        * ``NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON`` is **scrubbed** — it carries a
          credential-equivalent storage_state payload the child never needs
          (the child gets the on-disk storage path via
          ``NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_STORAGE_PATH`` instead). It is the only
          first-party storage_state credential payload we forward, so it is the
          one var we can scrub without risking the refresh contract.
        * ``_NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_ATTEMPTED`` is injected as the recursion guard.
        * ``NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_PROFILE`` / ``NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_STORAGE_PATH``
          are injected so the command refreshes the right profile in place.

        SECURITY: only ``NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON`` is scrubbed. We deliberately do
        **not** impose an allowlist, because a refresh command commonly
        re-invokes this library and legitimately needs much of the inherited
        env. As a consequence, **any other secret in the launching shell**
        (e.g. ``GOOGLE_*`` tokens, CI secrets, API keys — and any token the
        operator embeds in ``NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD`` itself) is inherited by
        the refresh command and every grandchild it spawns, and is visible via
        ``/proc/<pid>/environ`` to the same UID. Operators MUST NOT keep
        unrelated secrets in the environment that launches the refresh command;
        scope secrets to the processes that need them.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the refresh command is missing, parses to an empty

    """Fetch tokens with domain-preserving cookies from storage.

    Used by CLI helpers. Loads storage, builds jar, fetches tokens, optionally
    runs NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD on auth expiry, and persists any refreshed
    cookies back.

    Args:
        path: Path to storage_state.json. If provided, takes precedence over env vars.
        profile: Optional profile name exposed to the refresh command.
        authuser: Optional explicit Google account index. Defaults to the
            persisted profile value, or 0 when none exists.
        account_email: Optional explicit Google account email. When provided,
            it is used as the auth routing value instead of the integer index.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (csrf_token, session_id)

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If storage file doesn't exist.
        httpx.HTTPError: If request fails.
        ValueError: If tokens cannot be extracted from response.
