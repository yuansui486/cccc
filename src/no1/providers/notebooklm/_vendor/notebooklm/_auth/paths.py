"""Filesystem paths, env-var name constants, and lock-path computation for auth storage.

This module is **private** (note the ``_auth`` package prefix) and distinct
from the package-level :mod:`notebooklm.paths`, which owns the user-facing
storage-path / profile-resolution helpers (``get_storage_path``,
``resolve_profile``). The two intentionally share a name because both are
"path stuff", but their concerns don't overlap and they import each other at
most transitively via :mod:`notebooklm.auth`.

This module owns the environment-variable name constants that gate refresh /
keepalive behaviour and the helper that computes the rotation sentinel path
sibling to ``storage_state.json``. Centralising them here keeps the public
``notebooklm.auth`` surface compatible while the underlying logic lives in a
single, easy-to-audit module.

Three categories of names live here:

1. **Refresh command env vars** (``NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD``,
   ``NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD_USE_SHELL``, ``_NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_ATTEMPTED``)
   read by :func:`notebooklm.auth._run_refresh_cmd` and friends.
2. **Keepalive env var** (``NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE_POKE``) read by
   :func:`notebooklm.auth._poke_session` / ``_rotate_cookies``. Physically
   adjacent to the keepalive block in ``auth.py`` but conceptually an
   environment-variable name, not a keepalive parameter, so it lives here.
3. **Path helpers** (:func:`_storage_state_lock_path`,
   :func:`_rotation_lock_path`) that compute sentinel sibling files alongside
   the user's storage-state path.

The two refresh env vars and the keepalive env var are part of the documented
public surface of ``notebooklm.auth`` (see :data:`notebooklm.auth.__all__`);
``notebooklm.auth`` re-exports them by name. ``_REFRESH_ATTEMPTED_ENV`` and
``_rotation_lock_path`` are private but accessed as white-box affordances by
tests, so they are also re-exported.
