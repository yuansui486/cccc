    """Typed view of a raw note / mind-map row from ``GET_NOTES_AND_MIND_MAPS``.

    The wrapped row is the per-note list returned by the ``cFji9``
    (``GET_NOTES_AND_MIND_MAPS``) RPC. Two wire shapes coexist in the
    wild — the adapter absorbs both so consumers never branch on shape:

    * **Legacy** — ``[id, content_string]``: the JSON payload lives
      directly at position 1 as a string. Older cassettes and rows
      created before the metadata envelope rollout still arrive this
      way. There is no per-row title slot in the legacy shape; the
      adapter returns ``""`` for :attr:`title`.

    * **Current** — ``[id, [id, content_string, metadata, None, title]]``:
      the JSON payload lives at ``row[1][1]`` and the title at
      ``row[1][4]``. This is the production shape for any row created
      since the metadata envelope rollout.

    * **Deleted** — ``[id, None, 2]``: position 1 is ``None`` and
      position 2 is the soft-delete sentinel. :attr:`is_deleted` is
      ``True``; :attr:`content` and :attr:`title` both return ``None``
      / ``""`` respectively (callers should classify with
      :attr:`is_deleted` before reading other properties).

    Position knowledge is centralised here. Consumer sites should NEVER
    open-code ``row[1][1]`` / ``row[1][4]`` / ``row[1] is None`` — wrap
    the row in a :class:`NoteRow` and read through the typed properties
    instead. This is exactly the seam that lets a future Google reshape
    fix every consumer with one set of constant changes here.

    The dataclass is frozen so accidentally mutating the wrapped row is
    impossible through the adapter; the adapter itself never copies the
    raw row, so it is cheap to construct.
