"""Internal helpers for emitting the project's ``DeprecationWarning`` family.

Centralises the one-off ``warnings.warn`` calls so the message text, the
``NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS`` suppression gate, and the ``stacklevel``
bookkeeping live in a single, tested place instead of being copy-pasted at
every deprecated call site.

This is an implementation module. There is no public surface here; the public
deprecation *policy* (what is deprecated, since when, removal target) is
documented in ``docs/deprecations.md``.

Four families live here:

* ``warn_deprecated`` — the generic gated primitive for one-off deprecations
  that don't fit the three specific families below (e.g. awaiting
  ``from_storage(...)``, ``ResearchAPI.poll(task_id=None)`` ambiguity,
  ``NotebooksAPI.share()``). It exists so ad-hoc deprecations have a gated home
  rather than hand-rolling ``warnings.warn(...)`` and silently bypassing the
  suppression switch (issue #1369). Note that not every inline warning is a
  deprecation: ``save_cookies_to_storage(original_snapshot=None)`` emits a
  permanent ``RuntimeWarning`` race advisory (not a scheduled removal), so it
  is emitted inline and is *not* routed through here.
* ``warn_get_returns_none`` — marks ``<resource>.get()`` returning ``None`` on
  a miss as deprecated (issue #1247).
* ``deprecated_kwarg`` — the keyword-alias pattern used when a public method
  renames a parameter but keeps the old name working for one MINOR cycle. The
  canonical case is the wait/poll timeout standardization (issue #1208):
  ``ResearchAPI.wait_for_completion`` renamed ``interval`` to
  ``initial_interval`` (matching ``SourcesAPI.wait_until_ready`` /
  ``ArtifactsAPI.wait_for_completion``) and accepts the old name as a
  deprecated alias removed in v0.8.0.

* ``MappingCompatMixin`` — the dict-subscript backward-compat bridge used when
  a public method that historically returned ``dict[str, Any]`` is upgraded to
  a typed dataclass (issue #1209). Mixing it into the dataclass keeps the old
  ``result["key"]`` / ``result.get("key")`` / ``result.keys()`` /
  ``"key" in result`` access working (each subscript emits a
  ``DeprecationWarning``) while ``result.key`` becomes the typed, warning-free
  path. The mixin — and the dict-style access — is removed in v0.8.0.

These families share the single ``NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS`` suppression
gate (read live, never cached) and a parameterized ``stacklevel`` so the
warning's ``filename``/``lineno`` point at the *user's* call site. The warning
message always names the removal version (so ``scripts/check_deprecation_targets.py``
can verify the shipping release never names *itself* as the removal target), and
passing BOTH the old and new keyword raises :class:`TypeError` rather than
silently preferring one.

A second, orthogonal gate lives here too: ``NOTEBOOKLM_FUTURE_ERRORS``
(:func:`future_errors_enabled`). When on, the three runways above adopt their
v0.8.0 *target* behavior early — ``deprecated_kwarg`` and the
whole :class:`MappingCompatMixin` mapping surface (subscript plus the silent
``get`` / ``keys`` / ``in`` / ``iter`` shims) raise instead of warn (the
``<resource>.get()`` runway is routed through ``_lookup.resolve_get``). The same
gate also previews the purely-behavioral v0.8.0 changes that have no warn-runway
(issue #1405): the uninformative ``bool`` returns become ``None`` (#1290), a
synchronous generation refusal raises instead of soft-failing (#1342), and the
mutate-existing ops fail loud on a missing target (#1362). Those previews live in
the feature modules (each gated ``if future_errors_enabled(): ... else: ...``),
not here; :func:`future_errors_enabled` enumerates them. It is an opt-in
forward-compat preview, default-off, and takes precedence over the quiet gate
(a runway raises regardless of quiet; quiet only silences the warn path that
future mode replaces). See ``docs/deprecations.md``.

    generation refusal **raises** the decoder's ``RateLimitError`` / ``RPCError``
    / ``DecodingError`` / ``ArtifactFeatureUnavailableError`` instead of being
    swallowed into ``GenerationStatus(status="failed")`` / returned ``None``
    (#1342, across ``_call_generate`` / ``revise_slide`` /
    ``_parse_generation_result`` / ``research.start``); and the mutate-existing
    ops ``notes.update`` and ``sources``/``artifacts``
    ``rename(return_object=False)`` fail loud with a ``*NotFoundError`` on a
    missing target (#1362). These previews are **runtime-only** — no public

            message does not already name that version, a sentence naming the
            removal version is appended so every gated warning states its
            removal target consistently.
        removal: Optional removal version, e.g. ``"1.0"`` or ``"0.8.0"``. Pass
            a version when one is scheduled; the version is ensured to appear in
            the emitted text. Pass ``None`` in two cases — the message is emitted

            major release"). Always pass ``removal`` explicitly so a future
            reader patching the call to add a version knows where to put it.
        stacklevel: ``warnings.warn`` stacklevel. The default of ``3`` accounts
            for the single-hop case ``warn_deprecated`` (1) → the deprecated
            method/property (2) → the user's call site (3), so the warning's

            this helper (e.g. ``poll`` → ``_select_polled_tasks`` →
            ``warn_deprecated``). The default ``3`` is correct for any call made

    ``artifacts.generate_mind_map``, ``sources.get_guide``). Those returns are
    being upgraded to typed dataclasses so callers can use attribute access
    (``result.status``) and static typing. To stay backward-compatible for one
    MINOR cycle, the dataclass mixes this in: every legacy ``result["status"]``
    / ``result.get("status")`` / ``result.keys()`` / ``"status" in result`` keeps
    working against the *historical dict shape*, emitting a single
    :class:`DeprecationWarning` on each *subscript* access (``__getitem__`` only).
    The rest of the read-mapping surface — ``get`` / ``keys`` / ``items`` /
    ``values`` / ``__len__`` / ``__contains__`` / ``__iter__`` — stays silent
    **off the flag** so callers can probe shape without a warning storm.

    (#1251). In v0.8.0 the mixin is dropped and the dataclasses become
    attribute-only.

    The legacy values come from the subclass's ``to_public_dict()`` (the exact
    historical dict that method used to return) so nested access like
    ``result["sources"][0]["url"]`` keeps yielding the old dict-of-dicts shape
    rather than the new typed objects. Subclasses MUST implement
    ``to_public_dict() -> dict[str, Any]``.

    ``_COMPAT_KEYS`` is an optional key→attribute map used only to phrase the
