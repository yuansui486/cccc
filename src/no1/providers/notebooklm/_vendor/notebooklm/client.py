"""NotebookLM API Client - Main entry point.

This module provides the NotebookLMClient class, a modern async client
for interacting with Google NotebookLM using undocumented RPC APIs.

Example:
    async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
        # List notebooks
        notebooks = await client.notebooks.list()

        # Add sources
        source = await client.sources.add_url(notebook_id, "https://example.com")

        # Generate artifacts
        status = await client.artifacts.generate_audio(notebook_id)
        await client.artifacts.wait_for_completion(notebook_id, status.task_id)

        # Chat with the notebook
        result = await client.chat.ask(notebook_id, "What is this about?")

        Args:
            auth: Authentication tokens from browser login.
            timeout: HTTP request timeout in seconds. Defaults to 30 seconds.
            chat_timeout: Per-read HTTP timeout in seconds for
                ``client.chat.ask``. Defaults to 180 seconds because shared
                notebooks can be slow to send the first streamed byte. Pass
                ``None`` to inherit the normal client timeout for chat.
            storage_path: Path to the storage state file for loading download cookies.
            keepalive: Optional interval in seconds for a background task that
                pokes ``accounts.google.com`` while the client is open, eliciting
                ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` rotation so long-lived clients (e.g. agents,
                long-running workers) don't silently stale out. ``None`` (default)
                disables the task — preserving existing CLI semantics. Values
                below ``keepalive_min_interval`` are clamped up to that floor.
            keepalive_min_interval: Lower bound for ``keepalive`` (defaults to
                60 s) to avoid accidentally rate-limiting Google's identity
                surface.
            rate_limit_max_retries: Max automatic retries on HTTP 429.
                Defaults to ``3`` so programmatic users
                inherit "smart retry" behavior out of the box. Set to ``0``
                to raise ``RateLimitError`` immediately.
                Sleeps for ``Retry-After`` when the server provides a
                parseable header; otherwise falls back to capped exponential
                backoff ``min(2 ** attempt, 30)`` seconds with ±20% jitter.
                See the retry middleware docs for full sleep semantics.
            server_error_max_retries: Max automatic retries for retryable
                transient failures: HTTP 5xx and network-layer
                ``httpx.RequestError`` (timeouts, connect errors). Defaults to
                ``3``. Uses exponential backoff ``min(2 ** attempt, 30)``
                seconds. Set to ``0`` to disable.
            limits: HTTP connection-pool tuning (``ConnectionLimits``). ``None``
                (default) uses ``ConnectionLimits()`` defaults sized for typical
                batchexecute fan-out (max_connections=100,
                max_keepalive_connections=50, keepalive_expiry=30.0s). Widen
                for heavy batch workloads (FastAPI/Django services sharing one
                client across many concurrent requests).
            max_concurrent_uploads: Ceiling on simultaneous in-flight
                ``client.sources.add_file`` uploads. Defaults to ``4``. Each
                in-flight upload holds one open file descriptor for the
                duration of the upload, so the cap doubles as an
                FD-exhaustion guard against fan-out callers that would
                otherwise open dozens of files concurrently and exhaust
                the per-process FD limit. ``None``
                resolves to the default — unbounded uploads are
                intentionally rejected. Must be ``>= 1`` when supplied.
                Independent of the RPC pool sizing (uploads use their own
                ``httpx.AsyncClient`` against the Scotty endpoint and
                don't share the RPC connection pool).
            max_concurrent_rpcs: Ceiling on simultaneous in-flight RPC
                POSTs (``client.notebooks.list``, ``client.chat.ask``,
                etc.). Defaults to ``16`` — well below the default
                ``ConnectionLimits.max_connections=100`` so short-lived
                helper requests (auth refresh GETs, upload preflights)
                still have pool headroom. Pass ``None`` to disable the
                gate entirely; useful when an external rate-limiter is
                in front of the client or for single-shot CLI commands
                where the throttle is overhead. Must be ``>= 1`` when
                supplied, and must satisfy ``max_concurrent_rpcs <=
                limits.max_connections`` — the constructor raises
                ``ValueError`` otherwise (a semaphore that lets requests
                through that the pool can't fulfill would surface as
                opaque ``httpx.PoolTimeout`` rather than clean
                back-pressure). Before this gate was added, heavy
                fan-out workloads tripped pool timeouts before any
                upstream throttle could intervene.
            upload_timeout: Optional override for the ``httpx.Timeout`` used
                by the resumable-upload start handshake and the finalize
                POST in ``client.sources.add_file``. ``None`` (default)
                preserves the original hardcoded values (10.0s connect /
                60.0s read for start; 10.0s connect / 300.0s read for
                finalize). The supplied ``Timeout`` is used wholesale at
                both upload sites — specify all components explicitly
                (e.g. ``httpx.Timeout(10.0, read=600.0)``), or partial
                fields will fall back to httpx's own 5.0s defaults rather
                than the original 10.0s connect. Defaults are NOT changed
                silently for back-compat.
            on_rpc_event: Optional sync or async callback invoked after each
                logical RPC succeeds or fails. The callback receives a
                backend-agnostic ``RpcTelemetryEvent`` so applications can
                forward telemetry to logging, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, or
                another metrics backend without this package depending on one.
            cookie_saver: Optional injectable seam overriding
                the on-disk cookie writer used on close / refresh / keepalive.
                ``None`` (default) preserves the current behavior of resolving
                ``notebooklm._auth.storage.save_cookies_to_storage`` via a
                late-bound wrapper. Must be sync (``def``, not ``async def``)
                — it runs inside ``asyncio.to_thread``. Custom callables
                bypass the late-bind hop entirely.
            cookie_rotator: Optional injectable seam
                overriding the keepalive-loop cookie rotator. ``None``
                (default) preserves the current behavior of resolving
                ``notebooklm._auth.keepalive._rotate_cookies`` via a
                late-bound wrapper. Must be async — it is awaited from
                the keepalive loop.

        By default (``drain=True``), ``close()`` first stops accepting new

        down the transport. If the drain deadline (``drain_timeout``) is
        exceeded, the transport is still closed and the timeout is re-raised.

        Pass ``drain=False`` to skip the drain step and tear the transport
        down immediately (fire-and-forget semantics).

        BREAKING CHANGE: prior versions defaulted to ``drain=False``. Callers
        relying on fire-and-forget close semantics (e.g. via
        ``__aexit__``) will now block briefly on the drain step; pass
        ``drain=False`` explicitly to restore the old behavior.

        Cancellation-safety contract (audit finding I12):

        If the caller's task is cancelled while ``close(drain=True)`` is
        still waiting on ``drain()`` (e.g. ``asyncio.wait_for`` deadline,
        manual ``task.cancel()``), the underlying transport is STILL torn
        down before the cancellation propagates. The drain await
        explicitly catches ``CancelledError`` and schedules
        lifecycle close through ``asyncio.shield`` — the shield wraps
        the inner close in a ``Task`` that survives the outer
        cancellation, so the ``Kernel.aclose()`` it drives runs to
        completion in the background. On the normal-success and
        ``TimeoutError`` paths the same shielded close call runs inline.
        ``ValueError`` (and any other unexpected exception) from
        ``drain()`` propagates without an implicit close, matching the
        pre-I12 caller-error semantics asserted by
        ``test_close_with_invalid_drain_does_not_close_transport``.

        Practical guarantee:

        - **Normal-success and drain-timeout paths**: on return,
          ``is_connected is False`` and the underlying
          ``httpx.AsyncClient`` is closed synchronously.
        - **Cancel-during-drain path** (single cancellation): the
          shielded lifecycle close runs to completion synchronously
          before ``CancelledError`` is re-raised — Python does not
          re-raise ``CancelledError`` to the same task without an
          explicit re-cancel, so the await on the shielded Task
          blocks normally. On return, ``is_connected is False`` and
          the transport is closed.
        - **Cancel-during-drain path** (re-cancellation while awaiting
          the shielded close): the shielded lifecycle close Task is
          isolated from the second cancel by ``asyncio.shield`` and
          continues running in the background; the second cancel
          surfaces in the awaiter, is suppressed, and the *original*
          ``CancelledError`` is re-raised. ``is_connected`` settles to
          ``False`` once the background Task lands (callers can
          ``await asyncio.sleep(0)`` or poll to observe it).

        There is no path that leaves a live transport behind.

        Drain-hook ordering (issue #1161): feature-owned cancel hooks
        (e.g. ``artifacts.polls``) run BEFORE the drain wait, not just in
        the shielded lifecycle close below. In-flight artifact polls wrap
        themselves in ``TransportDrainTracker.operation_scope`` (see
        :meth:`notebooklm._artifact.polling.ArtifactPollingService._run_poll_loop_in_scope`),
        which increments the same in-flight counter ``drain()`` waits on.
        Without firing the cancel hooks first, ``drain()`` would block on a
        poll that the cancel hook is supposed to short-circuit — up to the
        poll's own 300s timeout. Running the hooks first lets ``drain()``
        observe a cancelled-then-settled count instead of parking on it. The
        lifecycle close below still re-runs the hooks; for the only
        production hook (``artifacts.polls``) that re-run is a cheap no-op
        because already-settled poll tasks are filtered out of
        :meth:`notebooklm._polling_registry.PollRegistry.active_tasks`.

        Note: the cancel-hook fire is NOT bounded by ``drain_timeout`` — that
        deadline budgets the drain *wait*. The production poll-cancel hook
        settles near-instantly (it cancels its tasks and awaits the
        cancellation gather), so this is a non-issue in practice; a custom
        feature hook that blocks indefinitely could still extend shutdown,
        and such hooks should bound their own work.

        - **Canonical (recommended):** use as an async context manager — no
          ``await`` on ``from_storage`` itself. The auth load and session open
          happen on ``__aenter__``.
        - **Legacy (deprecated, removed in v1.0):** await the call to obtain a
          built-but-unentered ``NotebookLMClient``. Awaiting emits a
          ``DeprecationWarning`` pointing at the v1.0 removal.

        Args:
            path: Path to storage_state.json. If provided, takes precedence over profile.
            timeout: HTTP request timeout in seconds. Defaults to 30 seconds.
            profile: Profile name to load auth from (e.g., "work", "personal").
                If None, uses the active profile (from CLI flag, env var, or config).
            keepalive: Optional interval in seconds for the background SIDTS
                rotation poke. ``None`` disables it (default). See
                :class:`NotebookLMClient` for full semantics.
            keepalive_min_interval: Floor for ``keepalive`` (defaults to 60 s).
            rate_limit_max_retries: Max automatic retries on HTTP 429.
                Defaults to ``3``. Set to ``0`` to
                restore raise-immediately behavior. See
                :class:`NotebookLMClient` for full sleep semantics.
            server_error_max_retries: Max automatic retries for HTTP 5xx /
                network errors with exponential backoff. Defaults to ``3``.
            limits: HTTP connection-pool tuning (``ConnectionLimits``). ``None``
                (default) uses ``ConnectionLimits()`` defaults sized for
                typical batchexecute fan-out (max_connections=100,
                max_keepalive_connections=50, keepalive_expiry=30.0s). Widen
                for heavy batch workloads (FastAPI/Django services sharing one
                client across many concurrent requests).
            max_concurrent_uploads: Ceiling on simultaneous in-flight file
                uploads via ``client.sources.add_file``. Defaults to ``4``.
                ``None`` resolves to the default. See :class:`NotebookLMClient`
                for full semantics (FD-exhaustion guard, independence from
                the RPC pool).
            max_concurrent_rpcs: Ceiling on simultaneous in-flight RPC
                POSTs. Defaults to ``16``; ``None`` disables the gate.
                Must be ``>= 1`` and ``<= limits.max_connections``. See
                :class:`NotebookLMClient` for the cross-validation rule
                and the rationale (the gate sits below the connection
                pool so back-pressure surfaces cleanly instead of as
                opaque ``httpx.PoolTimeout``).
            chat_timeout: Per-read HTTP timeout in seconds for
                ``client.chat.ask``. Defaults to 180 seconds. Pass ``None``
                to inherit ``timeout`` for chat.

        runtime directly, so test shells observe the same resolution path.
