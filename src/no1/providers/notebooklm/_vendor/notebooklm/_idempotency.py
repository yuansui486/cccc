"""Idempotency layer for mutating-RPC patterns.

This module hosts two cooperating pieces:

1. :func:`idempotent_create` — the existing per-API probe-then-retry
   wrapper for create-RPC patterns. A create RPC like
   ``NotebooksAPI.create`` or ``SourcesAPI.add_url`` is a mutating POST:
   the *server may have committed the write* even if the client sees a
   5xx or network error. Naive retries duplicate the resource; the
   wrapper inverts the direction: run with internal-retries disabled,
   then probe for a server-side commit before re-issuing.

2. :class:`IdempotencyRegistry` — the 5-policy classification layer that
   :class:`~notebooklm._rpc_executor.RpcExecutor` consults to compute the
   *effective* ``disable_internal_retries`` value. The registry is a
   single source of truth for every ``RPCMethod`` without touching the
   executor.

   The production registry is complete: every active ``RPCMethod`` has
   an explicit default classification, with variant rows for wire shapes
   like ``ADD_SOURCE`` and ``CREATE_NOTE`` where retry safety differs by
   call site. ``UNCLASSIFIED`` remains available only as a hand-built
   registry placeholder for tests and future development.

Per-API probes used by :func:`idempotent_create` are caller-supplied
because there is no universal probe key (notebooks: title +
baseline-diff; sources: url-match; ``add_text``: no probe possible — see
:class:`~notebooklm.exceptions.NonIdempotentRetryError`).

This module is private (``_idempotency.py``); call sites live in the
domain APIs (``_notebooks.py``, ``_sources.py``) and the RPC executor
(``_rpc_executor.py``). The canonical home for the taxonomy itself and
the per-RPC classification rationale is ADR-0005
(``docs/adr/0005-idempotency-taxonomy.md``).

    Args:
        create: Coroutine factory that issues the create RPC. The
            underlying ``rpc_call`` MUST be invoked with
            ``disable_internal_retries=True`` so the first transport
            failure surfaces to this wrapper instead of being retried
            blindly inside ``_perform_authed_post``.
        probe: Coroutine factory that returns the resource if it
            already exists server-side, or ``None`` if not. Probes are
            API-specific (notebooks: list-then-baseline-diff by title;
            sources: list-then-url-match).
        max_attempts: Maximum total ``create()`` invocations (default
            2 — one initial + one retry). Each attempt is followed by
            a probe; the probe runs only after a transport failure.
        label: Diagnostic label embedded in log messages.

    Returns:
        The result of a successful ``create()`` call, or the value
        returned by ``probe()`` after a transient transport failure.

    Raises:
        Whatever ``create()`` raises on the final attempt if the probe
        consistently returns ``None`` and retries are exhausted. Non-
        transport exceptions (auth, validation, decoding) propagate
        from the first ``create()`` call without invoking the probe.

    Cancellation:
        Pure ``await`` — no ``asyncio.shield``. A ``CancelledError``
        propagates immediately at the next yield point so the caller
        keeps full structured-concurrency semantics.

    the derivation and the per-policy rationale.

    Policies fall into three retry-safety bands:

      semantics; WARN logged).

      retry would race the probe), :attr:`NON_IDEMPOTENT_NO_RETRY`
      (e.g. ``add_text`` — no probe key, must surface the first

# GENERATE_MIND_MAP — generation RPC with no client-token slot.
# Params are ``[source_ids_nested, None, None, None, None,
# ["interactive_mindmap", [["[CONTEXT]", instructions]], language], None,
# [2, None, [1]]]`` (see ``ArtifactsAPI.generate_mind_map`` in
# ``_artifacts.py`` and ``_artifact.payloads.build_mind_map_params``).
# Every slot is structural (sources, content config, language, mode
# triple). The response carries the mind-map JSON directly
# (``generate_mind_map`` reads ``result[0][0]``) — there is no task_id to
# probe with after the fact, so token-dedupe is impossible here too.
#
# Note: ``GENERATE_MIND_MAP`` itself does NOT persist the note server-side
# (see ``tests/integration/test_mind_map_chain_vcr.py`` header). The actual
# persistence is the subsequent ``CREATE_NOTE`` + ``UPDATE_NOTE`` chain in
# ``NoteService.create_note``. PROBE_THEN_CREATE here suppresses the inner retry loop on
# the *generation* RPC for two reasons: (a) a blind re-POST wastes the
# expensive LLM inference, and (b) LLM nondeterminism means a retried
# generation may return a *different* mind-map JSON, which would
# silently mismatch what the client saw on the first commit before the
# response was lost. Classifying CREATE_NOTE for the persisted-write side
# of the chain is a separate follow-up (out of scope per the b-generation
# task spec, which restricted edits to the artifact-generation path —
# now folded into ``_artifacts.py`` — and ``_idempotency.py``).

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Active classifications — side effects and notebooks
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These entries replace the UNCLASSIFIED placeholders for mutating RPCs whose
# side-effect semantics are well-understood and stable. The full
# audit decision matrix lives in ADR-0005
# (``docs/adr/0005-idempotency-taxonomy.md``); the short version follows.
#
# CREATE_NOTEBOOK
#   Mutating create with an executable wrapper in ``NotebooksAPI.create``:
#   the caller captures a title/baseline probe before issuing the RPC and
#   retries only after probing for a committed notebook. Classification:
#   ``PROBE_THEN_CREATE`` so raw ``rpc_call(CREATE_NOTEBOOK, ...)`` disables
#   blind transport retries too.
#
# DELETE_NOTEBOOK / DELETE_SOURCE / DELETE_ARTIFACT
#   Server-side delete is idempotent: replaying the request after a 5xx /
#   network failure yields the same final state (the resource is gone).
#   Classification: ``IDEMPOTENT_SET_OP``. The transport retry loop keeps
#   running unchanged — today's behavior is preserved, the registry simply
#   documents *why* it is safe.
#
# REFRESH_SOURCE
#   Refresh kicks off a server-side fetch job. A duplicate refresh job is
#   harmless (extra bandwidth, same eventual content) but observable, so
#   the caller has accepted at-least-once semantics. Classification:
#   ``AT_LEAST_ONCE_ACCEPTED``. The transport may retry; the registry
#   emits a rate-limited WARN so operators can see the trade-off when it
#   actually fires.
#
# SHARE_NOTEBOOK
#   Mutates the shared-users / public-access ACL. A blind retry after a
#   network blip can re-send invitation emails (with ``notify=True``) or
#   flip access between RESTRICTED / ANYONE-WITH-LINK twice. The codebase
#   does expose a server-side probe RPC (``GET_SHARE_STATUS``) that can
#   list the current ACL, so the *correct* policy is ``PROBE_THEN_CREATE``
#   — the transport must NOT retry blindly, and a future wrapper can
#   ``get_status()`` to decide whether the prior call landed before
#   re-issuing. Today only the classification is in place (which suppresses
#   the blind retry); the caller-side probe-then-create wrapper is a
#   follow-up.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Active classifications — ADD_SOURCE + ADD_SOURCE_FILE
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ADD_SOURCE is variant-shaped: the call site distinguishes ``"url"`` (web /
# YouTube), ``"drive"`` (Google Drive document), and ``"text"`` (pasted
# content). Each variant has a different retry-safety profile because the
# server-side dedupe key differs:
#
# * ``"url"`` — probe by ``source.url == url`` on a notebook list. The probe
#   is a single GET_NOTEBOOK; the wrapper retries the create once if the
#   probe finds nothing. PROBE_THEN_CREATE.
# * ``"drive"`` — probe by ``file_id in source.url`` (Drive URLs embed the
#   file_id). Same wrapper as ``"url"``. PROBE_THEN_CREATE.
# * ``"text"`` — no reliable dedupe key (titles non-unique, body not
#   exposed in the source list). NON_IDEMPOTENT_NO_RETRY: force-disable the
#   inner transport retries and let the first failure surface so the caller
#   can decide. See the ``add_text`` rationale in
#   ``tests/integration/concurrency/test_idempotency_create.py:17-19``.
#
# ADD_SOURCE_FILE is single-shape: it registers a file source by name.
# Filenames are NOT identity-bearing (two uploads of ``report.pdf`` are
# legitimately two distinct sources), so the per-API wrapper captures a
# baseline of source IDs *before* the create attempt and filters probe
# matches to "new since the create started" sources only. Ambiguous
# matches (>1 new source with the same filename) raise rather than guess.
# PROBE_THEN_CREATE.
#
# These entries force-disable blind transport retries via
# ``resolve_effective_disable_internal_retries``. The per-API call sites in
# ``_source/add.py`` / ``_source/upload.py`` own the executable probe loop for
# the URL, Drive, and file variants.
