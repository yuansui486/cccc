"""Logging configuration and credential redaction for notebooklm-py.

The package logger is configured at import time via configure_logging(). Every
record reaching the package handler passes through a RedactingFilter that
mutates the record in place, scrubbing CSRF tokens, session cookies, and other
credential-shaped substrings from record.msg / record.exc_text. The handler's
RedactingFormatter is a decorator that wraps any inner formatter and post-
scrubs the rendered output as belt-and-suspenders.

propagate is left True so records flow to root for caplog / basicConfig users;
the in-place mutation ensures downstream handlers see scrubbed data.

# (``SNlM0e=...``), and in diagnostic prose (``SNlM0e value is AF1_QpN-...``).
# The marker name (and any quoting) is preserved; only the value is redacted.
# Split into three shape-specific patterns so each value class is anchored
# precisely and the capture groups are directly testable:
#   - QUOTED: ``"marker":"value"`` / ``'marker':'value'`` (JSON / inline JS).
#     Group 2 captures the verbatim run from the key's closing quote through
#     the value's opening quote (``"\s*:\s*"``) so it is reproduced exactly in
#     the replacement; group 3 is the value's quote char, back-referenced as
#     the closing quote. The value uses the escape-aware idiom
#     ``(?:[^"'\\]|\\.)*`` (mirroring the VCR cassette sanitizer in
#     ``tests/cassette_patterns.py``) so a JSON ``\"`` inside the value does
#     not terminate the match early and leak the tail. ``\s*`` around the
#     colon tolerates pretty-printed JSON.
#   - HTML_ESCAPED: ``&quot;marker&quot;:&quot;value&quot;`` (script block
#     rendered inside an HTML attribute). Terminates on the literal
#     ``&quot;``, so embedded entities (``&amp;``) survive into the redaction.
#   - UNQUOTED: ``marker=value`` / ``marker: value`` / ``marker value is value``
#     (query, form, or diagnostic prose). The value class excludes trailing
#     punctuation / brackets (``.?!)]}>``) so benign sentence punctuation and
#     enclosing parens are NOT swallowed into the redacted run.
# Each marker is its own alternation so capture group 1 is always the full

# ``_REDACT_PATTERNS`` MUST be paired with a token here (or a clear note
# that the pattern's literal anchor is already covered). Order is
# insignificant; the gate is an OR.
#
# Casing: tokens are stored lowercase and the gate compares against the
# lowercased input. This matches the ``re.IGNORECASE`` patterns (OAuth +
# Authorization) so a log line with ``AUTHORIZATION: BEARER ...`` or
# ``Refresh_Token=...`` still triggers the regex sweep and gets redacted.
# The cookie-name pattern is case-SENSITIVE in the regex (cookie names are
# canonical), but ``"sid"`` as a substring of a lowercased input also
# matches lowercase ``sid`` — which would NOT match the case-sensitive
# regex. False positives in the gate (input contains the substring but the
# regex doesn't match) are harmless: we just run the regex sweep unnecessarily.
# False negatives (input is a secret but the gate skips) would shrink the
# redaction surface, so we avoid them by erring toward more triggering.

# Deviation notes vs. the originating redaction design:
#   - The design's literal token list is mixed-case (``SID``, ``SAPISID``,
#     ``CSRF``, ``Cookie``, ``Authorization``, ``Set-Cookie``). We lowercase
#     the gate to honor ``re.IGNORECASE`` on those patterns. Token VALUES
#     change to lowercase; the COVERAGE story (and the resulting redaction
#     surface) is preserved.
#   - "_token=" and "code=" extend the design's literal token list. The
#     design advertises "superset of substrings in any pattern" but its own
#     list omits OAuth anchors; without them the OAuth pattern would silently
#     stop redacting whenever a message had no other secret marker.
#   - "continue=" and "authuser=" are NOT in ``_REDACT_PATTERNS``. Including
#     them is harmless: they only INCREASE the regex-sweep rate, never the
#     redaction surface, and they hedge against future audit additions.
#   - "csrf" covers the ``csrf=<value>`` form alias. The canonical CSRF
#     token shows up as ``at=<csrf>`` (covered by "at="); the standalone
#     ``AF1_QpN-`` token shape is covered by "af1_qpn-".
#   - "snlm0e" / "fdrfje" cover the WIZ_global_data CSRF / session-id markers
#     in their JSON, query, and prose shapes. They are lowercased to match
#     the lowercased input even though the marker regex is case-sensitive
#     (the markers are canonical mixed-case identifiers); the lowercase
#     substring still triggers the sweep, which is harmless if the regex
#     then misses.
#   - "sapisid" is redundant given "sid", but kept as documentation that we
#     deliberately cover that cookie family.
