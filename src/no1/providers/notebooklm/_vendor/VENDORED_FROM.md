## Scope

The upstream runtime modules from `src/notebooklm/` are vendored under:

- `src/no1/providers/notebooklm/_vendor/notebooklm/`

CLI-only assets, package entrypoints, and agent/skill installer surfaces are
intentionally excluded to keep the vendored product surface small. The vendored
package `__init__.py` is also kept as a CCCC-local minimal wrapper so importing
the adapter does not perform broad upstream imports or logging setup.

The CCCC adapter should use a narrow boundary API from
`src/no1/providers/notebooklm/adapter.py` and must not expose vendor internals
into daemon contracts.
